## Python Webscrape: Google Play Top Free Games

##### Background: 
For my first web scraping project, I wanted to see what I would be able to successfully scrape without a website crashing on me.

##### Objective: 
Scrape the first 300 games on Google Play's Top Free Games (link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/GAME/collection/topselling_free?hl=en) and collect the following data points to analyze comment key words associated with star ratings:
* Title of game
* Publisher
* Genre
* Content rating (i.e. for everyone, young children, or mature users)
* Number of reviews given
* Average star rating out of five stars
* Number of installs
* Last app update
* User comments

##### Results:
I was only able to successfully scrape a maximum of 60 games after numerous attempts, and I was unable to scrape the comments successfully. 
For the future, I will account for the refreshing of the list of games as the webpage is scrolled down on. I will also try to scrape text comments in order to do text analysis.
